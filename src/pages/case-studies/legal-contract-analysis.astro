          ## The Challenge

          A prestigious international law firm with over 500 attorneys was struggling with the time-intensive and error-prone process of manual contract review and analysis:

          - **Time-intensive reviews:** Senior attorneys were spending 60-70% of their time on routine document review
          - **Inconsistent analysis:** Different attorneys would identify different issues in similar contracts
          - **High costs:** Manual review was expensive and not scalable for large document volumes
          - **Human error:** Fatigue and time pressure led to missed clauses and potential risks
          - **Client pressure:** Clients demanded faster turnaround times without compromising quality

          The firm needed an AI solution that could accelerate contract review while maintaining the accuracy and nuance required for legal analysis.
