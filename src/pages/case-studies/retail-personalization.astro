          ## The Challenge

          A major e-commerce platform with over 10 million monthly active users was struggling with low conversion rates and poor customer engagement:

          - **Generic experience:** All customers saw the same product recommendations regardless of their preferences or behavior
          - **Low conversion rates:** Only 2.3% of visitors were making purchases
          - **Poor customer retention:** 65% of customers never returned after their first purchase
          - **Inefficient pricing:** Static pricing strategies weren't optimized for different customer segments
          - **Cart abandonment:** 70% cart abandonment rate with no personalized recovery strategies
