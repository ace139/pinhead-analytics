        ## The Challenge

        A global logistics company managing supply chains across 50+ countries was facing significant operational inefficiencies and rising costs:

        - **Inefficient route planning:** Manual route optimization was time-consuming and suboptimal
        - **Poor demand forecasting:** Inaccurate predictions led to overstocking and stockouts
        - **Inventory imbalances:** Difficulty in matching supply with demand across a complex network
        - **Lack of real-time visibility:** Limited ability to track shipments and respond to disruptions
        - **High transportation costs:** Suboptimal routing and vehicle utilization
        - **Siloed decision-making:** Different departments (e.g., warehousing, transportation, procurement) operated independently

        The company needed an integrated solution to optimize its entire supply chain, improve responsiveness, and reduce operational costs.
