          ## The Challenge

          A major healthcare system with 15 hospitals and over 200 clinics was facing significant challenges in providing consistent, high-quality diagnostic support across their network:

          - **Diagnostic variability:** Different physicians would reach different conclusions for similar cases, leading to inconsistent patient care
          - **Information overload:** Physicians struggled to stay current with rapidly evolving medical literature and treatment guidelines
          - **Time constraints:** Pressure to see more patients left limited time for comprehensive diagnostic research
          - **Rural clinic support:** Smaller facilities lacked access to specialist expertise for complex cases
          - **Training gaps:** New residents and physicians needed better support for complex diagnostic decisions

          The healthcare system needed an AI solution that could provide evidence-based diagnostic assistance while integrating seamlessly with existing workflows and maintaining physician autonomy in decision-making.

          ## Our Solution
