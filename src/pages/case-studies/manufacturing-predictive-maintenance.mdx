        ## The Challenge

        A global manufacturing company with 12 production facilities across three continents was experiencing significant operational challenges due to unexpected equipment failures:

        - **Unplanned downtime:** Equipment failures were causing an average of 15% production downtime across facilities
        - **High maintenance costs:** Reactive maintenance was 3x more expensive than planned maintenance
        - **Production bottlenecks:** Failures in critical machinery disrupted entire production lines
        - **Safety risks:** Catastrophic failures posed risks to personnel and equipment
        - **Inventory issues:** Unpredictable output led to difficulties in managing stock levels

        The company needed a proactive solution to anticipate equipment failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and minimize disruptions to their global operations.

        class AnomalyDetector:
            def __init__(self):
                self.isolation_forest = IsolationForest() # Example: scikit-learn's IsolationForest
                self.autoencoder = AutoencoderModel() # Example: Custom Keras/TensorFlow Autoencoder
                self.statistical_detector = StatisticalAnomalyDetector() # Example: Custom statistical model
            
            def detect_anomalies(self, sensor_data):
                # Ensemble approach for robust anomaly detection
                if_anomalies = self.isolation_forest.predict(sensor_data)
                ae_anomalies = self.autoencoder.detect_anomalies(sensor_data)
                stat_anomalies = self.statistical_detector.detect(sensor_data)
                
                # Combine results with confidence scoring
                combined_anomalies = self.combine_predictions(
                    if_anomalies, ae_anomalies, stat_anomalies
                )
                return combined_anomalies

            def combine_predictions(self, *predictions):
                # Placeholder for actual combination logic
                # e.g., weighted average, majority vote, etc.
                # This is a simplified example
                # Assuming predictions are anomaly scores (higher is more anomalous)
                # and are normalized or comparable
                num_predictions = len(predictions)
                if num_predictions == 0:
                    return 0 # Or handle as an error
                
                final_score = sum(pred for pred_array in predictions for pred in pred_array) / sum(len(pred_array) for pred_array in predictions)
