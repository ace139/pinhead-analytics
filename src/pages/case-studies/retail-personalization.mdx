        ## The Challenge

        A major e-commerce platform with over 10 million monthly active users was struggling with low conversion rates and poor customer engagement:

        - **Generic experience:** All customers saw the same product recommendations regardless of their preferences or behavior
        - **Low conversion rates:** Only 2.3% of visitors were making purchases
        - **High cart abandonment:** Over 70% of shopping carts were abandoned before checkout
        - **Poor customer retention:** Difficulty in encouraging repeat purchases and building loyalty
        - **Ineffective promotions:** Generic discounts and offers failed to resonate with specific customer segments

        The platform needed a sophisticated personalization strategy to deliver tailored experiences, improve customer engagement, and drive revenue growth.
